                                                         PROJECT SUMMARY
Project Title:  Building a Book Recommender System using Graph Neural Network
Background: Recommendation systems play a crucial role in promoting physical and digital content across various global platforms like Amazon, Apple, and Netflix. This project focuses on investigating the advantages of employing recommendation technologies specifically for books. By leveraging a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) implemented using PyG, the project aims to analyze interactions between users and books to make personalized recommendations.
Dataset: The project utilizes the Goodreads Book Reviews dataset, a subset of the Amazon Book rating dataset, containing interactions between users and books. It comprises approximately 2.9 million ratings from 52,643 users for 91,599 books. The dataset includes user-book interactions without additional metadata like user demographics or detailed book attributes.
Technology:  The project is implemented in Python using various libraries and tools. PyTorch Geometric (PyG) is employed to build and optimize the recommender system using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). The project utilizes PyG's functionalities for graph representation and manipulation. Additionally, other Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn are used for data manipulation, visualization, and model evaluation.The project is implemented in Python using various libraries and tools.

Model Architecture: Two types of graph convolutional layers are implemented: LightGCN and NGCF (Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering). LightGCN simplifies and powers graph convolution networks for recommendation systems, while NGCF is an older architecture that applies GCNs to recommender systems. The architecture of both models involves message passing between nodes in the graph to aggregate information and update node embeddings.
Loss Function and Metrics: The Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss function is utilized to optimize the model parameters based on user interactions with positive and negative items. Additionally, precision@K and recall@K metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the recommender system in recommending relevant items to users.
Results: The models are trained and evaluated over multiple epochs using training and testing datasets. The performance of the models is assessed based on total training loss, BPR training loss, regularization training loss, recall, and precision metrics. Both LightGCN and NGCF models achieve varying levels of recall and precision, indicating their effectiveness in recommending relevant books to users. However, LightGCN generally outperforms NGCF in terms of precision and recall metrics.
